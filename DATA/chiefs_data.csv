"2023-12-17",1702847139,"rice with another stellar performance  catches on  targets for  yards and a touchdown perfect game from him stud","Before this game he needed to average 85 yards over the last 4 games to amass 1,000 yards. 

He now needs to average 82 yards over the final 3 games to hit 1,000 yards. 

He's averaging 83.5 yards over the last 4 games, and over that same stretch he's gotten atleast 9 targets per game. 

I don't know how impressive or interesting this is for anyone else, but I will definitely be paying close attention to his chase to 1,000 yards as a rookie.","KansasCityChiefs",95,"https://www.reddit.com/r/KansasCityChiefs/comments/18kr9f4/rice_with_another_stellar_performance_9_catches/"

"2023-03-15",1678885214,"from the dark days to now","Its 2003, Trent Green is under center.. Priest Holmes is in the backfield, Tony Gonzalez is lined up to the right, Dick Vermeil is head coach and has led the Chiefs to a respectable 13-3 season, up until playing the Indianapolis Colts which leads to a 38-31 Chiefs playoff loss.. 

Just when we thought the tide was turning, we went another 12 years, 8 different QB1s, 3 different head coaches, and a new front office until our next playoff victory. It is also worth noting the Chiefs are still 2nd of all time for having the longest consecutive playoff losses (1994-2014).

I cant help but remember the early mornings listening to young Nick Wright on 610 Sports Radio while on the way to work, just hoping one day we (as a city) would be able to witness the chiefs just make it to a Super Bowl, regardless if we win. 

Fast forward to present day, we have appeared in 3 Super Bowls in the last 5 years, won 2 &amp; we are only getting started.. We have a generational QB1/possible GOAT under center, the greatest tight end to play the game, arguably the best play caller the NFL has ever saw as a head coach &amp; we are only continuing to grow as a team by keeping a younger roster &amp; dynamic offense for Patrick Mahomes/Andy Reid.. 

Dont let this era of dominance shown by the Chiefs fool you, this is not normal.. enjoy it, savor it, cherish it with your friends and loved ones who are also die hard Chiefs fans, because after Patrick retires, I highly doubt well ever see this level of success from the Chiefs in our lifetime.

Dude is a monster and Im super grateful we have him. Hes very good but what stands out to me is he runs every play as if he were still trying out for the team. 

He runs super hard and never seems to give up. He has a great finish. But one thing that is pretty cool is he immediately bounces back up and sprints back to the huddle. 

Hard to explain but you can tangibly see his work ethic and motivation.

They talked him into a hold-out at the wrong time. Had they done that at the beginning of the off-season, there would have been a trade market. No one was interested post-draft, post-FA, post-camp in making room for his contract.

They started a hard-ball negotiation with zero leverage and had to cave because the franchise tag was getting cheaper by the day.

When the dust settled, all they could offer Jones was getting the money he was originally gonna get paid BACK what he had to pay in fines if he made a bunch of incentives.

Now he's got 9.5 sacks. Gets a 1.25 million bonus if he gets to 10. And there's no good reason to risk him getting injured tomorrow.

He needs to fire those idiots.

Kelce is the Chiefs' leading receiver in basically every category that counts. Receptions, yards, TDs, YPC, you name it. But when you point that out people say, ""well yeah, because our receivers suck...""  

OK, they do - so how is Kelce doing vs other TEs in the league? How about this: 

- #2 in receptions (with 2 fewer games played than #1)  
- #3 in yards (again, fewer games than #1 and #2)  
- #1 in yards/game  
- Tied for #2 in TDs

I've been watching the quarterback show on Netflix and I didn't know that he compliments almost every pass rusher that goes after him. There are 300 pound dudes chasing him and slamming him into the ground, and he just gets up and goes ""that was a good ass rush dawg."" He got into it a little bit with Maxx Crosby in the first Raiders game but after the game he comes up to him gives him a hug and tells him he played a great game. I know there are a lot of guys in the NFL that have good sportsmanship but Mahomes is on another level. He'll kick your ass on the field, talk a little smack and then give you a hug and tell you to have a great rest of the season. It's nice to see a guy who is so talented and deserving of praise be so humble. He could totally be an arrogant douche and think he's better than everyone else and probably get away with it because he's that good. He doesn't act like that though, he seems really down to earth and an all around great guy. It's nice to be able to root for a guy and not have to ignore his baggage (*cough* Tyreek *cough*) or rationalize your support for them.

But watching the build up this week, Kittle is an absolute treasure. Just consistently a lovely, genuinely nice guy, especially with his interviews and how he treats people. On top of being a great player. He's just so fucking likable. 

I hope we destroy the 9ers and send them back to Santa Clara whining about having to wear white or some shit.

"2023-10-03",1696372075,"i watched my first american football game ever on sunday ","Firsts things first, I thought of posting this on the NFL sub but they seem kinda mean lol, this sub feels way more reasonable and welcoming to new fans (at least for the past week Ive been lurking on here). I just wanted to post this here because as a sports fan (although not American football) sometimes is interesting to see an outsiders perspective. But if everyone hates it and finds it annoying I (or the mods) can take it down. Finally, the usual English is not my first language bla bla bla if the post doesnt make any sense grammatically Im sorry.

So, Im not American, Im Brazilian, and because of that the main sport we watch in our household is soccer, I have grown up watching it everyday, the season runs from February to December here (insane I know), my father is crazy about his hometown team and we are always watching their games and regular season games as well.

This week, me (22F), my best friend (22F) and sister (20F) all decided to watch the Sundays Chiefs vs Jets game for the first time ever, you can probably guess why lol (we are big fans of Taylor Swift). So we all spent the week trying to learn the rules of the game, positions, strategies the teams like to use etc. To be honest the videos didnt work that well haha, I was very confused at the beginning and couldnt see the ball or understand what was going on. But as the game progressed things became clearer and I could figure it out better.

NFL is not popular in my country (AT ALL), the only thing most people know about it is that they call it it football and that Giseles husband played the sport lol. And thats basically all I knew about it too, Ive never watched the games, or the Super Bowl, not even the halftime shows. I was a strictly soccer, and sometimes volleyball, girlie.

Now onto the opinions, first the nice things:

- I thought that the game was super entertaining, the Brazilian narrator guys were super good, and I think sometimes even tried dumbing down some plays and stats because they knew a different audience would be watching this time.
- I thought the concept of intercepting is super fun, the narrator screaming (INTERCEPTOUUUUU) haha its great.
- Contrary to what a lot of people were saying on Twitter, I didnt think the game was boring or that the Chiefs were being humiliated (some people overreact a lot on Twitter Jesus). Im used to regular season soccer games, and they usually dont end in crazy scores, so I thought it was a good game, we could see that both sides really wanted to win and gave their all, it made the game more interesting and the stakes higher.
- I also really liked the visual effects, the green and black lines to mark the yard lines (dont know the correct terms sorry :/). The replays and little drawings to explain how that particular play strategy worked. It made the game easier to understand.
- I also loved the atmosphere and climate of the stadium, lots of kids and women, people from opposite teams sitting together with no problem. Here in Brazil we have a lot of problems with heavy violence between fans, specially for city derby games, so much so that my mother would forbid my father from taking me and my sister to the games when we were little. So its so nice to see everyone getting along and no fights.
- Finally, I also really loved Taylor of course :).

Now the bad things. I only have one thing to complain really, please dont murder me.

SO MANY COMMERCIALS!

Guys, its a little bit insane, we were pausing every like 10 minutes for commercials. And I understand why we have to pause the game, they need time to rearrange stuff, and when they change from offense to defense a whole new team has to get on to the field.

Like I get it. But why does every time the game pauses do they have to put on a commercial. Im sorry to compare it to soccer again but its the only thing I have to compare it to. Here we have pauses too, when someone gets hurt and needs to get evaluated by doctors, or the VAR team is reviewing a play, or we have a corner or a free kick. But the narrators usually use this time to review the play, or comment on stats for the teams in the championship, or even injury updates. We only have 15 minutes of commercials in between the halves.

And like I know, people have to stand up, and pee, and stuff, but I dont know just put like a 20 min break in between each half? Or shorter ones in between each quarter. Its not like the teams rely solely on ads for revenue and would go broke. From what Ive seen here and in other subs the tickets and merch are pretty expensive, and dont artists have to pay a fee to perform in the arenas? Thats gotta be a pretty good amount of money. If we could have less commercials I would enjoy it even more.

So thats it! Sorry for the super long post, I just felt excited and wanted to share with someone who watches American football since I have no one to do so :). My friend is coming here to watch it again on Sunday, even if Taylor doesnt attend, because we are genuinely interested in the game.

I guess Im part of the Chiefs Kingdom now =

P.S. I didnt know which flair I should add, hopefully this one is appropriate :)","KansasCityChiefs",157,"https://www.reddit.com/r/KansasCityChiefs/comments/16z5n42/i_watched_my_first_american_football_game_ever_on/"

"2023-12-25",1703541952,"how the raiders shut down the chiefs offense and why its going to happen again","The Raiders' defensive game plan against the Chiefs was pretty simple: start with the assumption the Chiefs receivers suck and go from there.  This dictated their entire defense scheme.

They started the game in a 5-2-4, then ran some variation of that defense all game long, with 5+ down rushers, a spy on Mahomes playing shallow zone, double coverage on Kelce (either straight doubling or with a man on him and zone everywhere else) and single coverage on the other receivers or a medium zone.  Sometimes they flat out let MVS run free.

The way to beat this kind of defense is really simple, your 1v1 or free receivers find the gaping holes in the zone or just beat their man and put up massive numbers.  You can also run crossing rub routes or timing routes or jet sweeps off a fake handoff.  We did try timing routes and none of our receivers could execute them, Hardman and Toney are our jet sweep guys, and they're both hurt.  

But overall it just comes down to the Raiders said ""your receivers suck so badly we're going to play a defense that loses horribly to anyone who can catch the ball past 5 yards downfield"" and it completely toasted our offense.

Again, MVS was literally left uncovered on some routes, displayed poor effort on others, and dropped the one target he had.  

The coaching collapse here was broad based and embarrassing.  I want to give the defense all the credit in the world for holding the Raiders to 6 points (the offense gave up 14 in 7 seconds), but the end of the game, when O'Connell was 1 for his last 10 for 1 yard and it was obvious to everyone in the country the Raiders were going to run to milk clock, letting them convert multiple 1st downs on the ground is just kind of.. well, really bad.

This game was as bad as losing to the Tebow Broncos or that one Jamarcus Russell game we lost to the Raiders.

I know everyone wants to say ""get Mahomes all the recievers"" next year and it'll be fixed, but the issues clearly go deeper than that.  Reid needs to take a hard look at his scheme this offseason, and we need to re-evaluate the running back room, Pacheco is great, but he (like almost all RB) gets hurt a lot, same with Jet, and CEH if he gets heavy usage (based on past experience with him).  

Finally, for the love of god, fire Embree and strongly reconsider Nagy's role.

But make no mistake, other teams are going to watch tape of this game and also build game plans based on overwhelming the line of scrimmage to shut down the run game and pressure Mahomes while daring him to throw deep to receivers who can't catch.","KansasCityChiefs",171,"https://www.reddit.com/r/KansasCityChiefs/comments/18qs9p1/how_the_raiders_shut_down_the_chiefs_offense_and/"

Theres already been some great games in the past between these two, with the Bills owning the regular season and the Chiefs owning the post season. And unlike the Bengals, there doesnt seem to be much animosity and vitriol between the two teams. As a fan, I might even find myself rooting for the Bills down the road in the playoffs (as long as they werent the ones knocking out the Chiefs), whereas I wish for all the bad things in football to happen to the Bengals and nobody else but the Bengals.

To our Chiefs haters across the world&d<È=

I know youre frustrated. As Chiefs fans, we get it. We, too, watched Tom Bradys Patriots win 6 Super Bowls while our team failed to ever draft a playoff-caliber QB. Our fans also waited 50 years between Super Bowl appearances, through many tumultuous seasons and changes in leadership. During that time, the teams fans were still showing up at 5am for tailgates, selling out every home game and making history as the loudest stadium in the world. 

When Andy Reid showed up in 2013 (because another team didnt want him anymore), we saw a glimpse of hope. In 2017, things changed even more-so, when we hit the jackpot on a once-in-a-generation type quarterback. Patrick Mahomes, among others drafted in recent years, have propelled this team to 6 straight AFC championship, and 4 SB, appearances under Reid. 

These wins were not bought  they were earned. 

The refs &amp; the NFL are not colluding in front of a billion people to get the Chiefs through to the next game. And inside, you know it. 

Flags, and no-calls, go both ways in these games. You are viewing from a biased perspective if you believe otherwise. 

Do I think we are lucky? Hell yeah, I do. So was Brady. We all know the saying& Luck is when preparation meets opportunity. Couldnt be truer when you have a dedicated owner, an incredible evaluator of talent at general manager, an innovative leader of men at the head coaching position and a cohesive unit of support staff and talented players throughout that franchise. 

We know what we are all witnessing as Chiefs fans. For some, it may not sink in until its all over. 

For the rest of the NFL and its fans  we are not asking you to like us, or not be upset. We do ask that you respect this team and its QB (who may be ultra-competitive at times, but is a great human being and one of the most talented players in this games history). 

We ask that you respect our HOF tight end, who was drafted to play here and has given his all to this game. You may be tired of seeing his girlfriend 3 times in 4 hours, but last I checked, she seems to be a pretty solid person as well  and has been in the media spotlight for years. 

Lastly, we ask that you respect us as fans. Weve been in your shoes. Some of you have been to Arrowhead, Kansas City, or at least interacted with a Chiefs fan, and I would bet the city and its fans treated you well. In fact, I bet we even said something nice about your team& 

And when the day comes, and Mahomes hangs up his cleats, a new dynasty will be born in another blue-collar city, and your team and your fan base will have our respect.

"2023-09-27",1695823758,"chiefs fans and arrowhead in general are very hospitable and great bears fan here","As the title states, you guys are very welcoming and great to opposing fans. I've never been to an NFL game as an opposing fan, so I was worried going into Arrowhead how we would get treated. You always see these viral videos of opposing fans getting beer/trash/etc. thrown at them (not speaking about Arrowhead specifically here), so I thought for sure this was happening to us. The fans were the exact opposite of this, from the tailgate, to the walk to the stadium, to during the game, to the suite life (more on that in a second), you guys were great to hang out with. I'm sure the fact that we posed absolutely 0 risk on the field helped our cause!  


My wife is a huge Swiftie, so at all of our tailgates we fly a T Swift flag along with our team flags as shown below. Shortly after the tailgate started, rumors started flying around that she was going to be at the game. Our tall flagpole here is 30', so pretty hard to miss. There were hundreds of fans that came by our tailgate, took pictures with our flag, and just chatted with us. There were a lot of Chiefs fans that hung out for a bit, drank a beer, and just had a great time. Tailgate was awesome, as was the 'pre-tailgate' that occurred while waiting in line.  


Now for the game, the play on the field was awful and we all know you guys laid a smackdown. We had upper level seats on the south side. The sun was beating down and it was very hot! No beer throwing or heckling going on from Chiefs to Bears fans, just everyone enjoying the 4 choppers flying over the stadium after the National Anthem (this was very awesome btw).   
Right before halftime my wife and I wandered down to the concourse to get some shade and cool off. There was a shaded patio type area with TVs, so we hung out there for a bit to watch the rest of the second half (why I was still concerned with the game at this point is beyond me!). We then walked around for a bit to explore your stadium. The drumline playing at the bottom of the spiral ramps was amazing! We leaned over the edge for about 10 minutes and watched them, people just tossing money down there and enjoying the show. A+ pseudo halftime show for us.   
Alright, drumline is over, time to head back to our seats. At this point, we had no idea where we were at. We were at the bottom of the spiral ramps where the drumline was playing, so all we knew was that we had to go up. A little bit of walking around and we happened upon an elevator. The elevator door opens and LEVEL 3 had a star next to it so we figured this must be the main concourse. 2 other guys hop in and they're also going to level 3. Ok, guess we're headed in the right direction! The elevator doors open up at 3 and we immediately realize that we're not supposed to be here as this is the suite level. My wife and I head back into the elevator when the 2 guys say, 'you're with us, c'mon'. Keep in mind we are decked out in Bears gear and these 2 guys are clearly Chiefs fans. So we follow them and next thing you know we're in a suite, 40 yard line, Chiefs side, with an amazing view of the field. Jim and Kyle were the 2 guys that brought us in. They introduced us to some people, offered us a few drinks, and were just great people to hang out with. Everyone in the suite was super friendly happy (or not mad at least) to have a couple Bears fans in there with us.  


The Bears were absolutely horrible, but Arrowhead Stadium, Chiefs fans, and especially Jim and Kyle were amazing hosts, so thank you!

&amp;#x200B;

You'd need to aim right in one of the holes of the visor, and you'd need enough force for it to wedge itself inside. He will have to key in on which specific hole to aim for, he likely would not be able to just aim at the face mask and hope it happens to wedge itself in one of the holes. That would be ridiculous. 

&amp;#x200B;

If he could add this to his repertoire we could potentially be looking at a top 5 offense and a top 5 defense come playoff time. ","KansasCityChiefs",59,"https://www.reddit.com/r/KansasCityChiefs/comments/18xels5/could_mahomes_throw_the_ball_hard_and_accurately/"

The facts: average 3.5 hour game has 18 minutes of actual football, Swift gets an average of 25 seconds of airtime, plenty of men get airtime at sports events (Jack Nicholson, Eminem, Matthew McConaughey) and no one complains. 

My take: great to point out the double standards and hypocrisy, but no need to go down the path of calling people who dont want to see Swift onscreen sad and lonely.

That is where these numbers are coming from.

- Jones camp offer:

3yrs, 84.5mil ($28.16mil/yr) with year 1 replacing his current $19.5mil salary. 

**New money** = $8.667mil raise + $28.167mil + $28.167mil = $65mil + 2 more years

= **$32.5mil/yr**

- Chiefs offer:

3yrs, $74mil ($24.66mil/yr) with year 1 replacing his current $19.5m salary.

**New money** = $5.167mil raise + $24.667mil + $24.667mil = $54.5mil + 2 more years

= **$27.25mil/yr**

Framing a contract offer in anything other than new money and new years is an asinine and intentionally misleading endeavor. Aaron Donald makes $31.67mil/yr and Chris Jones camp is asking for more than that and the report from Mike Florio is just another attempt by him to villainize our front office for taking advantage of star players.

Chris Jones agents refuse to walk away with anything besides an overt win from their golden goose and are going force a player who should be a Chief for life into being traded.

* Super Bowl 57 rematch. Chiefs obviously won the championship, but you can bet this is the most furiously circled game on the Eagles calendar.

* Both teams arrive to this game hot. Eagles are 8-1 and are atop the NFC. Chiefs are 7-2 and atop the AFC. Both teams will remain #1 in their conference by game time. The two top teams in each conference facing off this late in the regular season is exceedingly rare.

* Eagles will smell blood in the water seeing the Chiefs offense not look like the juggernaut that beat them in the Super Bowl. If theres a time for the Chiefs to finally put it all together this season, its now.

* Kelce Bowl rematch. The two most famous brothers in NFL history outside of Peyton and Eli Manning clash after both catapulting in fame over the last year. Their podcast this week will be pure hype.

* Bonus: Possible Taylor appearance. Travis Kelces new girlfriend Taylor Swift may fly directly from her tour to catch the game. Her childhood team was the Eagles so watching her cheer on their demise might prove traumatizing for Philly.","KansasCityChiefs",155,"https://www.reddit.com/r/KansasCityChiefs/comments/17uepav/chiefs_vs_eagles_is_the_most_juiced_regular/"

"2023-09-06",1694020296,"the men behind the chris jones negotiation a deep dive into the katz brothers","The business of sports agency has always been a bit shady. Players, especially young ones, are notorious for lacking real financial literacy or an understanding of the business of the NFL; yet before they even enter the league theyre left to select their own representation. Not every young player is Patrick Mahomes, the son of a former professional athlete, whose family understands this process and just how important this decision is - and vets their representation accordingly. There are plenty of stories of young impressionable college kids, whove never had access to large amounts of money before being bought by an agent for the price of some jewelry or a new car. Meanwhile these players have the potential to earn millions for that agent over the course of their career. This agent becomes the players primary financial advisor and negotiates contracts on their behalf. They are the voice thats in the players ear and an agent holds a tremendous amount of influence and power when it comes to contract negotiations.

Players are the public facing side of this partnership, and its easy for fans to put the blame solely on them for being greedy or selfish when contract negotiations roll around. However, the reality is that players, generally, have very little to do with these negotiations. Usually the player worries about ball, and leaves the business side to their agent. Though some players (Lamar Jackson, Laremy Tunsil, Richard Sherman, Russel Okung, Deandre Hopkins, and Bobby Wagner) with the business acumen to recognize the faults of the current system have chosen to forgo an agent and negotiate on their own behalf, most players stay out of the business side entirely and just sign on the bottom line when instructed to do so. When contracts are negotiated a players representation is often a better indicator of how negotiations are likely to proceed than the player themself. Many agents have a typical negotiating style, for example Drew Rosenhaus (Tyreek Hills agent) is known for being an absolute bulldog in fighting for top dollar (a situation that played out true to script in the Hill contract negotiations) whereas Leigh Steinberg (Patrick Mahomes agent) is known for working with teams on contract structures. With a lot of the well established agents you already know pretty much what youre going to get in negotiations before they ever start.

Because agents work on commission and get paid when players get paid, their notoriously reticent to accept team friendly contracts (they personally make less). It's also why you see players that are otherwise model teammates and locker room leaders doing things are seemingly out of character, like holding out of camp/games to gain leverage. For this reason, its generally unfair to blame the player for not taking a team friendly deal and assumptions about their character that they're greedy, selfish, or not a team first player - these negotiations and their tactics are largely the work of their agents. Listen to any interview with current or former players and the message is universally clear - players in the locker room do not judge their teammates for actions like holding out - business is business. Sure at the end of the day the agent works for the player, and a player can step in and tell them to get a deal done, but this is exceedingly rare.

Which brings us to the agents behind the Chris Jones contract negotiations - Jason and Michael Katz of Katz Brothers Sports. The brothers began their careers as NFL agents in 2013 under Drew Rosenhaus at Rosenhaus Sports. They left Rosenhaus Sports to join CSE in August of 2016 and then formed Katz Brothers Sports in January of 2018. Per Fanspo, the Katz Brothers represent the following players:

**Michael Katz Client List:**

* Micah Kiser - Out of the League
* Alfred Morris - Out of the League
* Zach Brown - Out of the League
* Scooby Wright - Out of the League
* Fred Ross - Out of the League

**Jason Katz Client List:**

* Chris Jones - Chiefs (4yr / 80 million)
* Jordan Mason - 49ers (3yr / $2.57 Million Rookie Contract) signed with KBS on January 28, 2023
* Chandon Sullivan - Steelers (1yr / $1.2 Million Veteran Salary Benefit Contract) 2020
* Olamide Zaccheaus - Eagles (1yr/ $1.2 Million Veteran Salary Benefit Contract)
* Keith Kirkwood - Saints (1yr / $1 Million NFL Minimum Contract)
* Byron Pringle - Commanders (1yr / 1.08 Million NFL Minimum Contract)
* Alfred Morris - Out of the League
* Chris Thompson - Out of the League
* Cyril Grayson - Out of the League
* TY Hilton - Out of the League
* Demarcus Robinson - Client from 2021 through 2022 now signed with Devin Brunson.

This doesn't paint the picture of a thriving business. Michael Katz doesn't have single currently active player on his client list. Jason Katz has just 6 active clients the vast majority of whom are clinging to the fringes of NFL rosters. The brothers were unable to sign a single rookie prospect out of the 2023, 2022, 2021, or 2020 draft classes (4 straight years of no success) and added just 1 UDFA from the 2019 Class (Zaccheaus). Going back, 2018 is the last time they actually landed a rookie prospect with a draftable grade (Micah Kiser in the 5th Round). The pipeline of talent coming in looks pretty dry. It appears their greatest success in finding clients has come from Chris Jones recruiting teammates to switch over (Byron Pringle and Demarcus Robinson).

Now let's look at their earnings...

* *Chris Jones (Reported Agent Offer):* ***Earnings:*** *$28,170,000* ***Agent Earnings:*** *$845,100*

\*All earnings calculated based upon the 3% agent commission cap imposed by the NFLPA.

Since Katz Brothers Sports opened their doors theyve generated just $1,256,364 in income from all of their clients not named T.Y. Hilton ($1,445,167) or Chris Jones ($1,907,737). Total revenue over a 5 year period is just $4,609,268. In total Chris Jones represents 42% of Katz Brothers Sports total earnings and T.Y. Hilton was responsible for another 32% of earnings, in total 74% of the KBS's total earnings have come from just 2 players.

With T.Y Hilton appearing to be headed towards retirement the financial situation at Katz Sports looks pretty dire. Katz Brothers Sports in total has just 6 players on its client list currently on NFL rosters and outside of Chris Jones all of those players are playing on either a Veteran Salary Benefit, Veteran Minimum, or Rookie UDFA contracts. The likelihood of any of their clients, aside from Chris Jones, landing a large contract extension in the future appears very unlikely, and they could easily have multiple clients out of the league in the near future. One thing is abundantly clear, the financial future of Katz Brothers Sports is inextricably tied to one contract - Chris Jones.

During the 2023-2024 season the Katz Brothers are set to make just $162,750 from all of their clients not named Chris Jones. Chris Jones will account for somewhere between 79% and 84% of Katz agencies total income this season. So while the 3.5 million in APY that reportedly separates the Chiefs and the Katz Brothers in the Chris Jones negotiations may not seem like much in the grand scheme of NFL contract negotiations, consider that just this difference alone would constitute 65% of Katz Brothers Sports Non-Chris Jones derived income.

Now let's examine the Katz's history with contract negotiations. Since venturing out on their own in 2018 the Katz brothers have negotiated just a few contracts that were not of a standard nature (rookie deals, veteran salary benefit, NFL minimum):

* 2018: The Katz's negotiated an extension on behalf of linebacker Zach Brown in Washington. During months of negotiation multiple reports surfaced that the two sides were far apart on value, that the Katz's were seeking a Top 10 LB contract, and rumors were leaked that Washington was ""lowballing"" Brown. Brown was allowed to test free agency, and just 24 hours later resigned in Washington on a very team friendly 3 year 24 million extension with just 5.5 million guaranteed (of which he played just 1 season), far below his reported asking price.
* 2020: Chris Jones signed a 4 year 80 million (60 million guaranteed) extension which was reached after Jones was franchised tagged. Jones was given a non-exclusive tag and allowed to negotiate with other clubs. During the offseason while Jones was tagged he threatened to sit out the season. The extension was reached just 1 day before the deadline and made Jones the 3rd highest paid DT behind Aaron Donald and Deforest Buckner (also extended in 2020), but with more guarantees than Buckner.
* 2021: A 1 year 10 million dollar extension (later re-negotiated down to 1 year 8 million) for T.Y. Hilton in Indianapolis. This deal was reached after initial negotiations broke down and the Colts refused to overpay. T.Y. Hilton was allowed to test free agency with the request from Chris Ballard that he be given the opportunity to match any teams best offer.
* 2022: Byron Pringle's 1 year 4.125 million (3.9 million guaranteed) free agent contract in Chicago after the Chiefs allowed him to become a free agent.

It's pretty apparent that the Katz brothers are relatively inexperienced when it comes to non-standard contract negotiations and especially green when it comes to big money contracts for star players. The Katz brothers track record of past negotiations shows a troubling trend of drastically over-estimating their player's market values. They appear to be difficult negotiators who often get greedy and refuse to accept reasonable offers. It's not until players are allowed to test free agency, and see that their initial value expectations are not realistic that a new deal is agreed upon - often by circling back and accepting the original offer. They've frequently employed threats of hold outs and used the NFL rumor mill as a tactic.

This is especially troubling because an important part of the agents job is to use their experience to help their clients gauge a realistic market value. To understand when to push for more money/years/guarantees and when to compromise or take what's offered. Sometimes that requires checking an athlete's unrealistic expectations. Experienced agents generally have the ability to do this well. Less experienced agents are more of wildcard. While you would hope each agent is negotiating in good faith to get the best deal for their clients, they can and do make mistakes and sometimes overplay their hand losing a client (and themselves) money in the process.

A prime example of this came recently in the form of Orlando Brown Jr. In March of 2022, Orlando Brown fired his agents Joe Panos (who also represents Chandler Jones, Frank Ragnow, Penei Sewell, Austin Jackson, and Anton Harrison) and Justin Schulman (who also represents Justin Herbert, Mark Andrews, and Fred Warner) of Athletes First (a large and respected agency) and hired Michael Portner, a rookie agent with no other NFL clients. At the time Brown was widely reported to be seeking a contract that would make him the leagues highest paid offensive tackle. For a player on the eve of such a massive contract negotiation to fire their agent was pretty shocking. This certainly wasn't because his existing agents lacked the ability to negotiate a high dollar contract - Schulman brokered the 2021 deal that made Fred Warner the NFL's highest paid linebacker and Panos was behind Frank Ragnow's 2021 contract that made him the league's highest paid center. Browns decision (per Mike Garafolo) revolved around the fact that he wanted an agent who didnt have prior relationships or friendships with any general managers. Portner will be negotiating his first NFL contract and Brown looked at that as a positive. Reading between the lines, Brown felt strongly that he should be the NFL's highest paid tackle while Schulman and Panos (both highly experienced and respected agents) felt his market value was somewhat lower, this led to a rift between the player and agent and ultimately Brown fired them to seek out representation that saw eye to eye on his perceived value - something that took months to find and ultimately came in the form of a rookie agent with no other clients (i.e. someone inclined to tell Brown what he wanted to hear).

Negotiations between Portner/Brown and the Chiefs reached a stalemate that ended with the Chiefs presenting a final offer (per Adam Schefter) of 6 years $139 million ($23.16M avg) that included a $30.25 million signing bonus and $95 million in first five years. On the surface this contract would have made Brown the NFL's highest paid tackle (just edging out Trent Williams) in terms of AAV. Brown and Portner rejected the deal citing a lack of guaranteed money. An objection that likely centered around the 44 million of unguaranteed money contained in the 6th year of the contract, that in reality was unlikely to be paid out. This would have given Brown a functional AAV of 19 million placing him him 6th behind Trent Williams, David Bakhtiari, Laremy Tunsil, Ronnie Stanley, and Ryan Ramcyk. Instead Brown and Portner opted to risk injury and play the 2022 season out on the franchise tag for just 16.67 million and test free agency the next year. Brown ultimately received a 4 year 64 million dollar (16 million AAV) with a 31 million dollar signing bonus contract from the Bengals. Ultimately, Brown lost 7.14 million dollars per year in AAV to gain just $850,000 in guaranteed money while risking injury and taking a pay cut in 2022. With the power of hindsight it's pretty clear Brown should have listened to Schulman and Panos and accepted the initial offer, even though it didn't meet his initial expectation, rather than taking the advice of a less experienced agent. It's critical to know when an offer is fair and to take the money on the board, not doing so can be very risky.

The Rams broke the defensive tackle market with Aaron Donald in much the same way the Browns broke the Quarterback market with Deshaun Watson. In Watson's case it was the fully guaranteed contract. In Donald's it was two fold, the Rams both threw out the remaining 3 years on Donald's existing contract and and agreed to pay Donald over 10 million more per year than the next highest paid DT. In the QB market teams have refused to acknowledge Watson's fully guaranteed contract as the new standard treating it as an outlier. In the defensive tackle market teams seem to be treating the Donald contract much the same. In the Chris Jones negotiations Chris' camp likely lead off with Donald's contract as their baseline - makes sense you would expect them to start high. The Chiefs front office likely lead off with Quinnen Williams contract as their baseline - makes sense you would expect them to start low. Through negotiations the expectation is that they'll find common ground somewhere in the middle with a contract that both acknowledges that the Aaron Donald exists (and that the gap between Donald/Jones and the next tier is fairly large) and recognizes that Donald's deal is somewhat of an outlier rather than the new NFL standard. Recent reports indicate that they've reached a stalemate at an extension of 2 years 54.5 Million (27.25 AAV) nearly fully guaranteed for the Chiefs and 2 years 64 million (32 million AAV)  for Jones camp. The two sides are just 9.5 million apart.

Chris Jones needs to take note of the Orlando Brown situation and start to question the quality of advice and representation his agents are providing him. Agents aren't infallible. He's already lost nearly 3 million dollars in fines (note that an agents payday isn't effected by fines just Chris'). And he's set to lose 8.6 million dollars more if he follows through on a Week 8 holdout. The council Chris is getting just isn't sound. He's set to lose more money holding out trying to gain leverage than he would gain if the Katz's demands were met. The Katz brothers are pushing for top dollar, largely because Chris is the one and only player keeping their failing business afloat. They're desperate, and likely willing to push this to free agency. This should be concerning for Chris given the Katz's have exhibited a clear pattern of overestimating their leverage and overplaying their hand in past negotiations. For Chris to stay the course only loses him money and causes him to take on more risk. The Katz's care only about the money and not about what Chris Jones the person and player actually wants. With these snakes in his ear, Chris has changed his tone from ""I'm a Chief for life. I will not play for another franchise."" back in March and being focused on winning Defensive Player of the Year in June, to threatening to sit out a substantial part of the season. Chris is obviously a part of this as well, but the men in his ear shape a lot of his actions. It might be time to call up some other agents and get a 2nd opinion on his market value and what a fair contract offer is. Chris strongly needs to consider what is truly important to him and what he wants his legacy to be. Ultimately the decision is his.

TLDR: When you dig into the financials of Katz Brothers Sports it becomes pretty apparent that Chris Jones is their lone breadwinner, and that the future success of the business is pretty directly tied to Chris' contract because they're struggling elsewhere. The Katz's also have a history of getting greedy in negotiations and overplaying their hand. Chris may want to seek alternative representation.","KansasCityChiefs",139,"https://www.reddit.com/r/KansasCityChiefs/comments/16bpuqd/the_men_behind_the_chris_jones_negotiation_a_deep/"

He's a pro athlete and gets paid to catch the ball, which he absolutely failed at last night and deserves some criticism for that.  To flat out disown him and troll the shit out of him for having one bad game, the first of the year after he missed the entire preseason recovering from knee surgery, is bandwagon BS and sad to see though.

He had one bad game people.  The guy helped us win a Super Bowl last year and played extremely well last season with the playing time he was given.  The Chiefs had enough confidence in him this offseason to say he's the hopeful #1 WR here.  He hasn't done anything wrong since signing here and is apparently liked in the locker room.  This isn't some trend that's formed from a stretch of bad performance that's been building up over time.  This was his first bad game as a Chief (that I can think of) and once again, he helped us win the freaking Super Bowl last year.  How about have your guy's back for a little while before dumping all over him.

I was super close to my grandpa. He loved to scrollsaw and his area of our shop sat dormant for the last 5 years gathering dust. I needed a new hobby and decided to try it out and fell in love. I use for the most part all of his old tools and keep the same layout of everything that he had (keep stuff in the same drawers etc) I'm sappy like that but it adds to my feeling of being close to him. 

Last picture is the rabbits he made for anyone that wanted one. I made one last week, (the 2nd thing I've ever cut out, Cheifs logo being my 4th) took a picture of it on his headstone and gave it to my grandma. We both cried..

"2024-01-04",1704386642,"mahomes is no longer in the goat discussion after this year","Here is how Mahomes ranks against other QBs this year. I have to tell you this ain't pretty and I think, honestly, that I agree with r/nfl  that he can no longer be considered in the conversation for GOAT. You just cannot put up numbers like this in your 6th year as a starter and be considered elite much less the best ever. You never EVER saw Brady put up numbers this bad:

https://preview.redd.it/yvopdhybagac1.png?width=400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2451ecd425bd86c35b06308f4d9b081505193c1b

Oh wait, except these are the numbers from **Brady's 6th year as a starter.**

&amp;#x200B;

Ok fine. But that's not why Brady is the GOAT, he's the GOAT because he wins Super Bowls. And with number like Mahomes has this year you just can't win the Super Bowl:

&amp;#x200B;

[All from Pro Football Refrence](https://preview.redd.it/a1tjnu1e8gac1.png?width=400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=619f2764cf44944264251d1cc32e728c21b7663e)

I mean with numbers like that you can't expect to win the AFC much less win the Super Bowl against a team like the 49ers probably the most complete team since the Legion of Boom Seahawks!

Wait, except those **ARE Brady's numbers from 2014** when he beat The Seahawks in the Super Bowl.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are Mahomes' numbers from this year:

https://preview.redd.it/3anu8zikagac1.png?width=400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eeff342b635e1f1f7cdcb5492459af4bd447dfa9

So in Mahomes' worst year he has better numbers than Brady did those other years in all but one category. But we're supposed to believe that Brady NEVER had a year like Mahomes' is having now and that it's impossible for The Chiefs to win the Super Bowl this year because Mahomes just isn't good enough to lead them there.","KansasCityChiefs",546,"https://www.reddit.com/r/KansasCityChiefs/comments/18yhjan/mahomes_is_no_longer_in_the_goat_discussion_after/"

"2024-01-15",1705340508,"dolphins fan flew up from south florida for game","Couple observations.

Fans:

First want to say, never been around a nicer fan base in my life and i've been to quite a few NFL and College stadiums. Not a single person said anything nasty and had multiple pleasant conversations throughout the night.  Granted we were in Club section, but still did alot of walking around and everyone was very nice inside the stadium and out.

Weather:

Was not nearly as bad as i had feared, but I guess when you wear 7 top layers and fully cover your face, bring hand &amp; feet warmers, goggles, etc., it allows you to just be cold, not very cold/miserable. Only thing thing that got numb was my right foot as i was luckily able to keep my left foot on the cardboard that the person next to me had brought in. The cardboard is truly a game changer, had no idea.

That being said, i looked up to the southeast upper deck and i have no doubt that was a drastically different situation in temperature/wind/experience. Also, the ability to spend the the time period before game inside and 10 minutes during halftime, was very helpful.

Finally, I've been in some extreme cold in my life and i have to say, the coldest i have ever experienced, was the time period exiting the stadium and getting to the car. The wind was on another level outside. There was definitely a significant difference in the temperature outside the stadium (before and after the game) than inside the stadium (during) IMO. It was downright brutal after the game ended in the parking lots.

Game:

Our mash unit D held up as good as you could possibly want. Our coach continues to baffle the mind however. Run successfully on 1st and 2nd and then throw the ball sideways on 3rd and 2 and 4th and 2 in 25 below wind-chill. We have a glaring hole at the TE position which would help big time when Waddle/Hill get bottled up on the outside. Also Mahomes had what seemed like 10 minutes in the pocket to throw. Offensive Line &amp; Kelce is your difference in the game.

&amp;#x200B;

Go beat the Bills....

One guy helped lead block.  Heck, I even shared Fireball minis with a few Bills fans.  

Did get quite a few ""F the Chiefs/Mahomes/Kelce/etc"" in general but that's to be expected. And that was the worst of it.  

Was a fun experience overall. Atmosphere was great. 
Stadium is kind of dumpy. 

Let the downvotes roll, but just saying what I experienced.

Peace! Go Chiefs!!!!","KansasCityChiefs",104,"https://www.reddit.com/r/KansasCityChiefs/comments/19d6xz2/bills_fans_slightly_different_perspective/"

"2023-02-14",1676397956,"jalen hurts is so good","I just want to pause amidst all our righteous celebration to point out that Jalen Hurts is *that dude.* Like, Pat was perfect, don't get me wrong - he is the best QB in the league by a country mile *and has been since he was drafted.* But in this single game, Hurts was - very nearly - perfect, as well. 

* 304 yards passing, with 1 TD and no INTs.
* 70 yards on the ground *with 3 more TDs* and a 2 point conversion - making him responsible for 20 points personally (well, him and the O-line, that sneak is nasty). Most in SB history.
27 of 38. 

I didn't watch much of Hurts this year, a few highlights, a few box scores  (while confidently asserting that Mahomes deserved MVP over him 100%...um, which I still believe, but acknowledge that it was closer than I thought) and thought he was a well-coached, hardworking QB being carried by an excellent roster. 

But that SB was a masterpiece, and I was having fun watching him even as I was dying of anxiety inside while he tore us apart. He made the throws he needed to make, he evaded pressure expertly, he made the right decisions with the ball 9 out of 10 times - like, if he'd been playing anyone other than Patrick Mahomes he would have been an all-time Super Bowl legend. 

To top it off, he and all of his teammates have been nothing but class both before and after the game. No bitterness, no trash talk, just respect before and after. My opinion of the Eagles - already pretty positive due to Andy, Kelce, family connections, and them beating the Pats - has gone up a thousandfold after this game. Hats off to them, to their fans (who have been amazingly cool the last two weeks, even to this day), and to Jalen. Dude's a real one and I'm definitely gonna be rooting for him to ball out (safely in the NFC) next season.

Anyway, just wanted to pause to tip the cap to I think the best QB and team we've faced in the playoffs under Mahomes. Back to our celebrations.","KansasCityChiefs",218,"https://www.reddit.com/r/KansasCityChiefs/comments/112bv87/jalen_hurts_is_so_good/"

I am specifically talking about social media's obsession with him and Barstool Sports' recent article ""Jackson Mahomes can't help himself from ruining everything"".

In the article, it rips him apart for dancing on the field during Super Bowl celebrations. It even goes as far as to say that the Mahomes family needs to go on the Maury Povich show for a paternity test because ""I am willing to bet my life that Pat Mahomes Sr is in no way responsible for cursing the world with Jackson"".

I'm sorry, but this is straight-up bullying from grown adults. Just because one brother is an athlete doesn't mean the other has to follow in his footsteps. He doesn't need to act more masculine or whatever other similar comments people are posting. Grown adults on the internet are acting like high school bullies.

of course they never call fouls on hail marys.

Mahomes and our receivers have no chemistry. They also can't get open. I mean damn Mahomes is escaping the pocket and nobody can come to the ball?

Defensively we had a rough first half and did better in the 2nd half but we had too many defensive miscommunications leaving guys WIDE open.

We really have to figure out or offense because man.. it sucks rn

"2023-02-14",1676387559,"this was the greatest chiefs season of alltime right","Maybe an argument for 2020 since we finally got another Super Bowl but this season:

-Chiefs win the fucking Super Bowl

-Mahomes is MVP and sets the record for most total yards in a season. First QB since Kurt Warner to win Super Bowl and MVP. First QB to lead league in passing yards and win Super Bowl

-17-3. Most wins in Chiefs history

-Undefeated in the division and win it for the 7th straight year

-Chris Jones has an amazing season with 15.5 regular season sacks and adds 2 more in the playoffs. Arguably deserves Defensive Player of the Year

-Frank Clark continues his playoff dominance. The Shark moves to 3rd all-time in playoff sacks. 

-Travis Kelce his usual dominate self, with the gap between him and the 2nd best tight end the largest in history by many metrics. His mind meld with Mahomes gives the duo on multiple records and playoff accolades 

-Exciting mid season trade that got us an explosive option for the future that helped us win the Super Bowl

-Had an amazing draft again to begin the year and with picks and decent cap to run it back next year. 

-Draft is in KC so we can continue to bask in the glory of the Super Bowl on the National Stage




**Non-Chief specific highlights (if you are into that sort of thing)**

-Donkeys have a comically inept season that will affect them long term

-Raiders also a shit show with epic collapses weekly

-Chargers with a historic playoff collapse akin to the playoff Chiefs of old. Chargers gonna Charger

-Beat the Bungholes getting that monkey off our back and causing their fanbase face to melt like Nazis in Indiana Jones

Am I missing anything?

"2024-01-11",1704992598,"my son shoveled snow for two days to buy a playoff ticket","My 14 year old son got bored during the snow days and decided to grab a friend and shovel driveways for extra cash. When he finished he had a good chuck of change and he was thinking about what do to with it.

I think the best thing to do would be to save it I told him first, attempting to be a responsible parent. But, just so you know, tickets for the playoff Chiefs game are the cheapest theyll ever be. Youll have to go back outside and itll be -15, but if you want to use your money to buy a ticket then Ill buy my ticket and take you.

My son did not hesitate, in fact he went out and shoveled more so he could afford the best possible ticket. He made $130 over two days and well be sitting in section 114 close to the tunnel in the first 10 rows. Hes hoping for a player pic/autograph - which I told him wasnt likely - but were both fired up to get so close to a field at a playoff game.

I share this half as a proud Dad moment, but half as an encouragement to get out to the game. This game is for us. Nobodys kid is shoveling snow for two days and grabbing a $700 ticket (unless yours did, in which case congratulations to you both) but for a $50 or $60 get in price, its fully possible. This is a die hard game and the passion and joy that will be there on Saturday night will be well worth sitting in the cold. 

Cant wait to see you all Saturday night. Go Chiefs!","KansasCityChiefs",110,"https://www.reddit.com/r/KansasCityChiefs/comments/1946jxb/my_son_shoveled_snow_for_two_days_to_buy_a/"
